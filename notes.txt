#use dictionary list for this program, store info from txt file to dict list
#c = 0 while (c<n) 
#Entercourse = input("  ")
#if Entercourse in 'sometype of list'
    #print "Course already on your schedule"
#Else add to list c++

studentList = [.......]
for c in range len(studentList) //this could be my master loop for schedulig
courses[studentList [c]] - get the first course from 'studentList'
^^^ refer to picture in my photos for a function like this,
*** this function will use recursive.





unittests
--------------
#create new section object for each line. 
#if key exists add to new list, if not then create new. 
#unit test so user doesnt ask for more courses than offered
#unit test that returns all the unique course numbers as a list
#unit test that compares if two sections overlap, compare (section0 and section1) 
#if days are different then yes let it schedule, if the days are different
the function has to make sure the times arent overlapping with if else 
statements.
if days same look at start and end times see if the end time is before the start
time of next class  ** refer to picture of n queens problem on my photos.
parameters we care about for this overlapping function is the day, starttime, endtime.
