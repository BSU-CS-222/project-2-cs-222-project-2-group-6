#use dictionary list for this program, store info from txt file to dict list
#c = 0 while (c<n) 
#Entercourse = input("  ")
#if Entercourse in 'sometype of list'
    #print "Course already on your schedule"
#Else add to list c++

studentList = [.......]
for c in range len(studentList) //this could be my master loop for schedulig
courses[studentList [c]] - get the first course from 'studentList'
^^^ refer to picture in my photos for a function like this,
*** this function will use recursive.

unit test that tests to see if user doesnt request the same class more than once.
Have separate unit tests for two course sections for overlap like for the days, hours

variables and functions should be snake case  
Classes should be camel case
WE NEED BIGGER CLASSES.txt INPUT FILE, more courses, 10 differnt courses with each course having
5 different sections.

unittests
--------------
#create new section object for each line. 
#if key exists add to new list, if not then create new. 
#unit test so user doesnt ask for more courses than offered
#unit test that returns all the unique course numbers as a list
#unit test that compares if two sections overlap, compare (section0 and section1) 
#if days are different then yes let it schedule, if the days are different
the function has to make sure the times arent overlapping with if else 
statements.
if days same look at start and end times see if the end time is before the start
time of next class  ** refer to picture of n queens problem on my photos.
parameters we care about for this overlapping function is the day, starttime, endtime.


make sure when showing availabe courses it only prints unique course codes
Also, when inputting number of courses to register for, if the number is higher than the number
of UNIQUE courses, it should throw an error.
